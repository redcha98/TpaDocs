# Using the Synoptic Panel

During the machine operation, it is possible to open the Synoptic Panel window to verify the status of the most important devices.

Synoptic panels display the same information contained in the diagnostic window. However, while in the latter the information is displayed in a tree structure (which includes all the devices present on the machine), synoptics illustrate the information graphically (displaying, for example, an image of the machine and setting the position of the axes next to the axes themselves). Synoptics also allow to select the most significant information, grouping the remaining information in secondary screen pages, to be recalled by the user when necessary.
