# Multilingual Support

Albatros supports the display of text in multiple languages.


## Change language

The language may be changed at any access level of the system. To select a different language, you need to use the key combination **Ctrl +** / or click on the icon  from the Windows "task bar".

In the window that will open, select the language required and click on **[OK]**.


:::caution 

The language change will not take place immediately, but at the following restart of Albatros.
